# Welcome to the FreeCasino project!
This is planned to be a free and open source cross-platform Java casino program. I am still working on the basic structure, but the following games are planned for its initial release:
1. Baccarat
2. Big Six
3. Blackjack
4. Craps
5. Keno
6. Poker (many popular variations of both ring and video poker
7. Red Dog (both the American double-zero game and the European single-zero game)
8. Roulette

I am open to adding more games over time (sic bo, British and Australian pontoon, more poker games, etc.) but I think this is a good set of games to start with.

Feel free to chip in if you'd like to help!
